# Course Scoring Application

The Course Scoring Application is designed to track events, courses, and athlete performance. It allows users to explore events, view athlete participation, and analyze scoring data across different competitions.

## Potential Real-World Use Cases

While this site isn't currently being used by any organization, there are many features that could be valuable. Analytics-focused companies could benefit from the comparison and performance-tracking features. Vendors could showcase training programs and goals for specific events. There are many other potential applications as well.

## Inspiration

I've been working on this project on and off for years. Its primary purpose is as a training ground where I can continually refine my architecture. In fact, this project has served as a reference architecture for other applications I've launched, so it has already provided significant value. While many sites exist that display race results, for this project I am the _“product owner”_ and sole contributor — all features were designed and developed by me.

## Technology Stack

This project was built using a modern, cloud-native technology stack focused on scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity. The backend is written in **C#** and **SQL Server**, while the frontend uses **Next.js**, **shadcn/ui**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application is hosted on **Azure**, with deployment automated via **GitHub Actions**.

**Note:**
While the application is fully functional, the athlete and event names are synthetic — generated using the **Bogus** library to create realistic data at scale. Any resemblance to real people or events is purely coincidental.
